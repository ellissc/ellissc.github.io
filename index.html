<h1>Ellis Cain</h1>
<p>I am a 4th year student at Indiana University studying Cognitive Science (Linguistics concentration) and Chinese. I work in Dr. Chen Yu's Developmental Intelligence Lab on the Human Simulation Paradigm project using computational methods to study statistical learning of language. I am interested in exploring topics in computational linguistics and natural language processing, such as semantic analysis and word representation, authorship verification, and overlap with computer vision methods.</p>
